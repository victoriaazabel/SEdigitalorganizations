Since the last review of these nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (Numts) in animals, Numts have been found in 53 of the species studied. The recent evidence suggests that Numts are not equally abundant in all species, for example they are more common in plants than in animals, and also more numerous in humans than in Drosophila. Methods for avoiding Numts have now been tested, and several recent studies demonstrate the potential utility of Numt DNA sequences in evolutionary studies. As relics of ancient mtDNA, these pseudogenes can be used to infer ancestral states or root mitochondrial phylogenies. Where they are numerous and selectively unconstrained, Numts are ideal for the study of spontaneous mutation in nuclear genomes.\",\n\"mitochondrial DNA; evolution; DNA sequence; genetic linkage; genetic marker; human; mitochondrion; molecular evolution; nonhuman; phylogeny; pseudogene; review; sequence analysis; spontaneous mutation; Animalia\",\n\"AGRI\"],\n [{\n            'v': 78,\n            'f': \"78\",\n        },\n\"The role of honey in the management of wounds.\",\n\"[No abstract available]\",\n\"bandage; evidence based medicine; honey; human; injury; methodology; nursing; pathophysiology; practice guideline; review; skin care; treatment outcome; wound healing; Bandages; Evidence-Based Medicine; Honey; Humans; Practice Guidelines; Skin Care; Treatment Outcome; Wound Healing; Wounds and Injuries\",\n\"NURS\"],\n [{\n            'v': 313,\n            'f': \"313\",\n        },\n\"Low-voltage ride-through of a full converter wind turbine with permanent magnet generator\",\n\"The low-voltage ride-through capability of a 2MW full converter wind turbine with permanent magnet synchronous generator is investigated herein. A detailed description of the system, its controller options and its behaviour when subjected to a severe voltage dip, is presented. A control scheme for the turbine that allows it to withstand severe voltage dips is designed and simulated. This control scheme emphasises the regulation of the dc-link voltage and minimisation of the drive train torque surplus.

Developmental studies that include assessments of both hormonal changes and social changes through the pubertal transition are needed to investigate joint biological and environmental influences on the emergence of the gender difference in depression in puberty. Although subthreshold mood disorder symptoms are common, controversy exists about their clinical significance. This controversy is made more complex by methodologic uncertainties regarding inconsistent symptom reports obtained from parents, teachers, and children and by the pervasive existence of comorbidity. Retrospective reports about age of onset in adult studies suggest that at least 50% of youngsters with major depression and 90% of those with mania continue to have adult recurrences. These recurrences are mediated by adverse role transitions, such as truncated educational attainment and teenage childbearing, that typically occur before the time of initial treatment. Aggressive outreach and early treatment aimed at preventing the occurrence of adverse role effects might help decrease the persistence of child and adolescent mood disorders. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to resolve current uncertainties regarding nosology, methodology, and long-term treatment effects. Innovative epidemiologic research designs aimed at more quickly providing provisional information are also needed to advance understanding of long-term developmental processes. \\u00a9 2001 Society of Biological Psychiatry.\",\n\"adolescence; adolescent pregnancy; adult; affective neurosis; child; comorbidity; comparative study; depression; disease classification; hormone action; human; long term care; mania; methodology; onset age; priority journal; puberty; recurrent disease; review; sex difference; social evolution; socioeconomics; symptomatology; Adolescent; Adolescent Psychology; Child; Child Psychology; Humans; Mood Disorders; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Prevalence; Time Factors\",\n\"NEUR\"],\n [{\n            'v': 423,\n            'f': \"423\",\n        },\n\"Multiagent systems: a survey from a machine learning perspective\",\n\"Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) has existed as a subfield of AI for less than two decades. DAI is concerned with systems that consist of multiple independent entities that interact in a domain. Traditionally, DAI has been divided into two sub-disciplines: Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) focuses on the information management aspects of systems with several components working together towards a common goal; Multiagent Systems (MAS) deals with behavior management in collections of several independent entities, or agents. This survey of MAS is intended to serve as an introduction to the field and as an organizational framework. A series of general multiagent scenarios are presented. For each scenario, the issues that arise are described along with a sampling of the techniques that exist to deal with them. The presented techniques are not exhaustive, but they highlight how multiagent systems can be and have been used to build complex systems. When options exist, the techniques presented are biased towards machine learning approaches. Additional opportunities for applying machine learning to MAS are highlighted and robotic soccer is presented as an appropriate test bed for MAS. This survey does not focus exclusively on robotic systems. However, we believe that much of the prior research in non-robotic MAS is relevant to robotic MAS, and we explicitly discuss several robotic MAS, including all of those presented in this issue.\",\n\"Artificial intelligence; Human computer interaction; Information management; Intelligent robots; Large scale systems; Problem solving; Robotics; Sampling; Surveys; Communicating agent; Distributed artificial intelligence; Distributed problem solving; Heterogeneous agent; Homogeneous agent; Intelligent agent; Multiagent system; Robotic soccer; Robot learning\",\n\"COMP\"],\n [{\n            'v': 1180,\n            'f': \"1180\",\n        },\n\"Nonparametric instrumental regression\",\n\"The focus of this paper is the nonparametric estimation of an instrumental regression function \\u03c6{symbol} defined by conditional moment restrictions that stem from a structural econometric model E[Y-\\u03c6{symbol}(Z)|W]=0, and involve endogenous variables Y and Z and instruments W.

Using a network model endowed with a columnar architecture and based on the physiological properties of cortical neurons and synapses, we have examined the synaptic mechanisms of selective persistent activity underlying spatial working memory in the prefrontal cortex. Our model reproduces the phenomenology of the oculomotor delayed-response experiment of Funahashi et al. (S. Funahashi, C.J. Bruce and P.S. Goldman-Rakic, Mnemonic coding of visual space in the monkey's dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. J Neurophysiol 61:331-349, 1989). To observe stable spontaneous and persistent activity, we find that recurrent synaptic excitation should be primarily mediated by NMDA receptors, and that overall recurrent synaptic interactions should be dominated by inhibition. Iso-directional tuning of adjacent pyramidal cells and interneurons can be accounted for by a structured pyramid-to-interneuron connectivity. Robust memory storage against random drift of the tuned persistent activity and against distractors (intervening stimuli during the delay period) may be enhanced by neuromodulation of recurrent synapses. Experimentally testable predictions concerning the neural basis of working memory are discussed.\",\n\"n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; article; interneuron; monkey; neuromodulation; nonhuman; prefrontal cortex; primate; priority journal; pyramidal nerve cell; synapse; synaptic transmission; working memory\",\n\"NEUR\"],\n [{\n            'v': 913,\n            'f': \"913\",\n        },\n\"Chromatin accessibility pre-determines glucocorticoid receptor binding patterns\",\n\"Development, differentiation and response to environmental stimuli are characterized by sequential changes in cellular state initiated by the de novo binding of regulated transcriptional factors to their cognate genomic sites 1-3. The mechanism whereby a given regulatory factor selects a limited number of in vivo targets from a myriad of potential genomic binding sites is undetermined. Here we show that up to 95% of de novo genomic binding by the glucocorticoid receptor, a paradigmatic ligand-activated transcription factor, is targeted to preexisting foci of accessible chromatin. Factor binding invariably potentiates chromatin accessibility. Cell-selective glucocorticoid receptor occupancy patterns appear to be comprehensively predetermined by cell-specific differences in baseline chromatin accessibility patterns, with secondary contributions from local sequence features. The results define a framework for understanding regulatory factor-genome interactions and provide a molecular basis for the tissue selectivity of steroid pharmaceuticals and other agents that intersect the living genome. \\u00a9 2011 Nature America, Inc.

Retrograde tracers were injected into selected areas of the IPS, superior temporal sulcus, and parietal lobule. The distribution of labeled cells was charted in relation to architectonically defined borders throughout the hemisphere and displayed on computer-generated three-dimensional reconstructions and on cortical flat maps. Injections centered in the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) revealed a complex pattern of inputs from numerous visual, somatosensory, motor, and polysensory areas, and from presumed vestibular- and auditory-related areas. Sensorimotor projections were predominantly from the upper body representations of at least six somatotopically organized areas. In contrast, injections centered in the neighboring ventral lateral intraparietal area (LIPv) revealed inputs mainly from extrastriate visual areas, consistent with previous studies. The pattern of inputs to LIPv largely overlapped those to zone MSTdp, a newly described subdivision of the medial superior temporal area. These results, in conjunction with those from injections into other parietal areas (7a, 7b, and anterior intraparietal area), support the fine-grained architectonic partitioning of cortical areas described in the preceding study. They also support and extend previous evidence for multiple distributed networks that are implicated in multimodal integration, especially with regard to area VIP.
